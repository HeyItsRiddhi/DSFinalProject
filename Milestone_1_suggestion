Project statement:

Predicting voter turnout among ethnic groups using a name-based nationality classifier on voter data without racial information.

Questions:

Can we classify indiv. by race (high precision, low recall)
How did turnout among minority voters compare in 2016 to earlier years? 
What is the probability that a certain ethnic group voted?
How do certain ethnic groups vote? Are there differences? (i.e. latinos in Miami are sometimes republican because theyre cuban, but otherwise latinos generally vote dem)
What factors are best at predicting voter turnout (did they turnout v notâ€¦then do anaysis )
How do our results compare to predicted polls?

EDA
Are there other trends related to voter turnout?
- age
- political party
- urban/suburban
- Absentee 
- Certain Elections (primary, general, etc)
- years since got a voter ID (i.e. are people who just got their voter registration more likely to vote?)


Note for you guys: If I do a lot of the data cleaning, and creating a matched DF of all of Florida, 
do you mind if I lend you guys the EDA and then sit out? So I would do more work this weekend, 
and then less work over the upcoming week. I see now that combining all the counties and matching will take a while :)
